Hello there,<br>
This will be my first repository that I will share in Github.<br>

In this repository, I want to share the basics knowledge that I learn for **HTML 5**.<br>
Hopefully, this will be my experience as well as my cheatsheet along with the way.<br>
In order to keep everything organize, i store everything in *env* folder.<br>

From now on, I will use **bold** typing for functions.<br>
*Italic* typing for folder or file.<br>
>Quote section for code blocks like these<br>
Hopefully it will be as clear as I want it to be...<br>

The real cheatsheet and explanations will be in **env/README.md** file.<br>
Just as a side note, i use Linux Mint for OS. but for HTML, doesn't matter that much... <br>

#### Hopefully Learn and Enjoy
